# Design Patterns

Included in this repository are simple C implementations of the design
patterns described in [Design Patterns](http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Design-Patterns-Elements-of-Reusable-ObjectOriented-Software/9780201633610.page)
by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (collectively known as the Gang of Four).

This is more of a personal challenge to work through all the design
patterns over time and have an example implementation for reference.

# Why C?

C is a rudimentary programming language that doesn't have any out-of-the-box
support for the design patterns. Most higher level languages such as Java or
Python have built-in support for some of the structural patterns such as
iterators or decorators.

Granted, the patterns in the book are geared towards object-oriented programming
languages such as C++, and C is no technically a OOP language. However, this
adds to the challenge of implementation and deepens my study of them.
